### What's this?
It is an app which currently takes in lyrics and gives the name of the song with the name of artist, album and *lyrics*.<br>
With that user also gets to see some songs by that artist and more songs in that album.

### How's this built?
Well it's not all APIs, some coding is done apart from that to extract *full lyrics* and song covers.

### What's new?
Maybe you will like the UI. Swipe feature in the found song is also awesome *try that*.
